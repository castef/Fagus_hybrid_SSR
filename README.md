Nemo-age is a spatially explicit individual-based simulator of exo-evolutionary dynamics (\url{https://nemo2.sourceforge.io/} ). 
Here we include the Input files and NEMO .ini scripts to run the Nemo-age simulations conducted in the study: "Assisted gene flow in forestry practice: assessment of risks and benefits 100 years after replicate introductions of Caucasian beech in Western Europe".
