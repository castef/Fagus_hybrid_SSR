# R scripts 

Includes R scripts used to perform all the steps of the analysis conducted in the study "Assisted gene flow in forestry practice: assessment of risks and benefits 100 years after replicate introductions of Caucasian beech in Western Europe". In this study, we used NewHybrids to identify hybrids between European and Caucasian beech based on genotype data, we assessed spring phenology of the two species and studied their mating dynamics (spatially explicit mating model), and simulated the hybridization between the two species in two real forests. 
In addition, we developed a R wrapper to prepare Nemo-age input files which can be applied to any species and any simulation landscape. 

# Nemo-age

Nemo-age is a spatially explicit individual-based simulator of exo-evolutionary dynamics (https://nemo2.sourceforge.io/). 
Here we include the Input files and NEMO .ini scripts use to run the Nemo-age simulations conducted in the study: "Assisted gene flow in forestry practice: assessment of risks and benefits 100 years after replicate introductions of Caucasian beech in Western Europe".
