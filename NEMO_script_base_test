## TESTING PARAMETERS

# low resolution grid: 8m x 8m

## SIMULATION ##
run_mode 	overwrite
random_seed 	2
root_dir 	C:/Users/Camilla/NEMO		## root directory for simulation
filename 	Allenwiller_FSTAT_results	## output file name of simulation
logfile		nemo.log

replicates 	1				## taking the source population from different simulations if >1
generations 	30 				

source_pop 	 Allenwiller_FSTAT_F0_extended.txt		## file with adults only!!!! 
source_file_type .txt 				## FSTAT format
source_preserve  			      	## keeping the individuals from the imported population (adults) ?
source_fill_stage adults 			# no age information is provided in the FSTAT file, it's safer to just load every one in the adult age class [FG] 
						# 32 is wrong, not working! set the stage to lead from the source population - only the last age class/stage number 5 (1000 = 32 in binary, least important bit is to the right, bits correspond to stages in reverse order)

## POPULATION ##
patch_number	1628  				## n of patches for a grid 8 x 8 meters 
patch_nbfem	&NEMO_patch_capacity.txt	## Carrying capacity of each patch (K):
# ? values/patch corresponding to the "real world" seedling density recorded in the forest! makes sense?

### AGE STRUCTURE and TRANSITION MATRIX ###
pop_age_structure	{{0,5,30,70,110}}  	## 0=offspring,5=seedlings,30=first reproducing age,60-90=adults - age at which the trees transition to the next class

pop_transition_by_age  				##  transition happens at max age for each stage (useful when juveniles require decades before transitioning to a reproductive stage

pop_transition_matrix {{0,	0,	40,	40,	50}      ## FECUNDITY (mean N offspring in 8 m radius)
                       {0.30,	0,	0,	0,	0}	## P(transition)
                       {0,	1,	0,	0,	0}	## P(survival) on diagonal
                       {0,	0,	1,	0,	0}	## Tot Survival(year) = P(t) + P(S) = [0,1] = 0.98 OR 1 ?
                       {0,	0,	0,	1,	1}}   

	## stage 0 (offspring): no reproduction, P(T) = 0.300138 - yearly survival rate until the age 5 --- to increase??? FROM GERMINATION trials? from Wilkens 2022
 	## stage 1 (seedlings): no reproduction, from age 5 they all survive??? to decrease??? 
  	## stage 2 (30): reproduction starts, adults have a very high survival P and they all go to the next stage 
   	## stage 3,4 (adults stages): reproduction, adults have a very high survival P and they all go to the next stage = P(S)=0.98, P(T)=1


## LIFE CYCLE EVENTS ##
breed		1  # breeding with backward migration (WF model) --> for overalpping generations
disperse	2  # only seed dispersal
regulation      3
save_stats      4  # census
aging_multi     5  # stage transition (after disperse, to save data for both adults and offspring)

### ? is this order correct if I want to save the demographic information/patch for both offspring and adults? 

# DISPERSAL
#dispersal_matrix	&NEMO_seed_dispersal_matrix.txt

# ***ERROR*** the size of the female dispersal matrix is not equal to patch_number X patch_number (2650384[1628,1628] != 40335201)!

# OR

dispersal_connectivity_matrix	 &NEMO_seed_connectivity_matrix.txt       ## matrix where each row has all the patches ID connected to a focal patch (1 row / patch)
dispersal_reduced_matrix	 &NEMO_seed_rate_matrix.txt               ## P to leave the natal patch - size of connectivity matrix, contains only the patches values where seeds can fall (skip patches with 0)

# ***ERROR***  The female connectivity dispersal matrix must have as many rows as the number of patches in the population
### dim(connectivity and dispersal matrix) = 1628 x 1628 !!!
### ? how to handle rows with only 0 ?? just empty {} ? # 

## MATING SYSTEM ##
mating_system	6		## 6 - rm with selfing (only females used - considered hermaphrodites) NB: requires patch_nbfem and patch_nbmal
